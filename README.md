This project clusters human activity data using accelerometer and gyroscope readings. 
Two clustering methods, K-Means and DBSCAN, were optimized with dimensionality reduction 
techniques (PCA and t-SNE) for more precise activity grouping. The study highlights the 
effect of tuning and dimensionality reduction on cluster structure, offering insights into 
activity recognition patterns.
